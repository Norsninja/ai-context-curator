# AI Context Curator

A lightweight Electron clipboard manager designed specifically for maintaining context between AI coding sessions. Perfect for developers who work with AI assistants and need to preserve important context, code snippets, and project notes across conversations.

## What It Does

This tool helps you:
- **Organize context** for multiple projects simultaneously
- **Preserve important information** between AI sessions (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- **Quickly copy** relevant context to share with AI assistants
- **Track code snippets** that need attention or discussion
- **Maintain project-specific prompts** for consistent AI interactions

## Features

- üìÅ **Multi-Project Support** - Manage context for multiple projects independently
- üìå **Pinned Main Prompt** - Keep your primary context/instructions always visible
- üìù **Context Cells** - Create unlimited cells for different aspects of your project
- üìã **Smart Clipboard** - Select and copy multiple cells at once
- üíæ **Auto-Save** - All changes persist automatically to local storage
- üéØ **Focused Design** - Clean, distraction-free interface
- ‚ö° **Lightweight** - No frameworks, just vanilla JS and Electron

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/context-manager.git
cd context-manager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm start
```

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Create a Project**: Click the dropdown and select "New Project..."
2. **Set Main Prompt**: Click the main prompt area to add your primary context
3. **Add Context Cells**: Click "+ Add Cell" to create cells for:
   - Current task descriptions
   - Code snippets needing attention  
   - Error messages to debug
   - Architecture decisions
   - API documentation snippets
   - Conversation history highlights
4. **Copy to AI**: Select cells with checkboxes and click "Copy Selected"
5. **Paste in AI Chat**: Share the context with your AI assistant

### Example Use Cases

#### Debugging Session
```
Main Prompt: "You are helping me debug a React application with TypeScript"

Cell 1 - Error Message:
"TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined at ProductList.tsx:45"

Cell 2 - Relevant Code:
"const products = data.response.items.map(...) // data.response might be null"

Cell 3 - What I've Tried:
"Added console.log - data.response exists but items is undefined sometimes"
```

#### Feature Development
```
Main Prompt: "We're adding user authentication to an Express.js API"

Cell 1 - Requirements:
"JWT-based auth, refresh tokens, 2FA support, social logins"

Cell 2 - Current Structure:
"routes/auth.js handles login, models/User.js has schema, missing middleware"

Cell 3 - Next Steps:
"Need to implement refresh token rotation and add rate limiting"
```

## Project Structure

```
context-manager/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js       # Application initialization
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ store.js     # Data persistence layer
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui.js        # UI rendering and interactions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.js     # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html       # Main application window

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js          # Electron main process
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json     # Project configuration
```

## Data Storage

Your data is stored locally at:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/context-manager/`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/context-manager/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/context-manager/`

File: `curator-data.json` contains all projects and cells

## Why This Tool?

When working with AI assistants on coding projects, context is everything. This tool solves the problem of:
- **Lost context** when starting new chat sessions
- **Repeated explanations** of project structure
- **Scattered notes** across different files and apps
- **Inconsistent prompts** leading to varied AI responses
- **Manual copying** of multiple relevant snippets

Unlike generic note apps, this is purpose-built for AI collaboration with features like multi-select copying and persistent main prompts.

## Philosophy

- **Lightweight**: No heavy frameworks or dependencies
- **Focused**: Does one thing well - manage AI context
- **Local**: Your data stays on your machine
- **Simple**: Clean codebase that's easy to modify
- **Practical**: Built by a developer for real development workflows

## AI Handoffs

This project includes a handoff system for seamless context transfer between AI sessions. The handoff file (`.claude/commands/handoff.md`) provides crucial context when starting new conversations.

### Creating Your Own Handoff

A good handoff file should include:

1. **Project Overview** - Brief description of what you're building
2. **Current Status** - What's working, what needs attention
3. **Active Issues** - Specific problems to solve
4. **Recommended Reading** - Key files to review first
5. **Context History** - Important decisions and changes

Example structure:
```markdown
Project: [Your Project Name]
Status: [Current state]
Active Issue: [What needs immediate attention]

Recommended Reading Order:
1. /path/to/critical/file - Why it's important
2. /path/to/related/file - Context needed

Key Context:
- Major decision made and why
- Current architecture approach
- Known limitations
```

The handoff file acts as your AI assistant's briefing document, ensuring productive sessions from the first message.
