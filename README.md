## What It Is

A simple tool to manage your AI session context. Keep your main prompt and session handoffs organized, then copy them together to start each AI conversation with full context.

## How It Works

1. **Main Prompt** - Your standard greeting/instructions that you use every session
2. **Context Cells** - Add handoff messages, project status, or any context you need
3. **Copy & Paste** - Select what you need and paste into your AI chat

That's it. No complicated features, just a clean way to manage AI session continuity.

## Features

- **Multi-project** - Keep different projects separate
- **Auto-save** - Never lose your context
- **Collapsed view** - See everything at a glance
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- **Local storage** - Your data stays on your machine

## Why This Exists

After losing context repeatedly between AI sessions, I built this to maintain continuity. It follows a simple workflow:
1. Start each session with your main prompt
2. Include relevant handoff context
3. AI has full understanding from message one

It's basically a clipboard manager optimized for AI session management.
