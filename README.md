- ‚ö° **Lightweight** - No frameworks, just vanilla JS and Electron

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Release (Easiest) üéØ
**No coding required!** Just download and run:

1. Go to [**Releases**](https://github.com/Norsninja/ai-context-curator/releases)
2. Download for your system:
   - **Windows**: `AI.Context.Curator.Setup.exe` (installer) or `AI.Context.Curator.exe` (portable)
   - **Mac**: `AI.Context.Curator.dmg`
   - **Linux**: `AI.Context.Curator.AppImage`
3. Double-click to run - that's it!

### Option 2: Build From Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Norsninja/ai-context-curator.git
cd ai-context-curator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm start

# Or build your own executable
npm run dist
```

### Option 3: Build With Your Data Pre-loaded
```bash
# Copy your existing data (if you have any)
cp ~/.config/context-manager/curator-data.json ./default-data.json

# Build with your data included
npm run dist

# Your exe will now start with your projects pre-loaded!
```

### Building on WSL for Windows
If you're using WSL and want to build for Windows:
```bash
# Install electron-builder
npm install --save-dev electron-builder

# Build Windows executable from WSL
npm run dist-win

# Find your exe in dist/ folder
ls dist/*.exe
```

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Create a Project**: Click the dropdown and select "New Project..."
2. **Set Main Prompt**: Click the main prompt area to add your primary context
3. **Add Context Cells**: Click "+ Add Cell" to create cells for:
   - Current task descriptions
   - Code snippets needing attention  
   - Error messages to debug
   - Architecture decisions
   - API documentation snippets
   - Conversation history highlights
4. **Copy to AI**: Select cells with checkboxes and click "Copy Selected"
5. **Paste in AI Chat**: Share the context with your AI assistant

### Example Use Cases

#### Debugging Session
```
Main Prompt: "You are helping me debug a React application with TypeScript"

Cell 1 - Error Message:
"TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined at ProductList.tsx:45"

Cell 2 - Relevant Code:
"const products = data.response.items.map(...) // data.response might be null"

Cell 3 - What I've Tried:
"Added console.log - data.response exists but items is undefined sometimes"
```

#### Feature Development
```
Main Prompt: "We're adding user authentication to an Express.js API"

Cell 1 - Requirements:
"JWT-based auth, refresh tokens, 2FA support, social logins"

Cell 2 - Current Structure:
"routes/auth.js handles login, models/User.js has schema, missing middleware"

Cell 3 - Next Steps:
"Need to implement refresh token rotation and add rate limiting"
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

## Project Structure

```
context-manager/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js       # Application initialization
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ store.js     # Data persistence layer

```

## Data Storage

Your data is stored locally at:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/context-manager/`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/context-manager/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/context-manager/`

File: `curator-data.json` contains all projects and cells

## Why This Tool?

When working with AI assistants on coding projects, context is everything. This tool solves the problem of:
- **Lost context** when starting new chat sessions
- **Repeated explanations** of project structure
- **Scattered notes** across different files and apps
- **Inconsistent prompts** leading to varied AI responses
- **Manual copying** of multiple relevant snippets

Unlike generic note apps, this is purpose-built for AI collaboration with features like multi-select copying and persistent main prompts.

## Philosophy

- **Lightweight**: No heavy frameworks or dependencies
- **Focused**: Does one thing well - manage AI context
- **Local**: Your data stays on your machine
- **Simple**: Clean codebase that's easy to modify
- **Practical**: Built by a developer for real development workflows

## AI Handoffs

This project includes a handoff system for seamless context transfer between AI sessions. The handoff file (`.claude/commands/handoff.md`) provides crucial context when starting new conversations.

### Creating Your Own Handoff

A good handoff file should include:

1. **Project Overview** - Brief description of what you're building
2. **Current Status** - What's working, what needs attention
3. **Active Issues** - Specific problems to solve
4. **Recommended Reading** - Key files to review first
5. **Context History** - Important decisions and changes

Example structure:
```markdown
Project: [Your Project Name]
Status: [Current state]
Active Issue: [What needs immediate attention]

Recommended Reading Order:
1. /path/to/critical/file - Why it's important
2. /path/to/related/file - Context needed

Key Context:
- Major decision made and why
- Current architecture approach
- Known limitations
```

The handoff file acts as your AI assistant's briefing document, ensuring productive sessions from the first message.
